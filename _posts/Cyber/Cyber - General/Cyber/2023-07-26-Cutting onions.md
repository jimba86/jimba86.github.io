Tor is a browser used to access the nonclearnet side of the internet. and was developed by the tor project (www.torproject.org) 

While some think that tor has bad stuff on it it also is a good way to find security research information and learn about upcoming events before they happen (eg: leaks of data) and how to think like a hacker (a good defense is a good offense)
