Intels P55 Platform is the top of the line for the LGA 1156 Socket of Processors made by Intel. This was first launched back in 2009 following the High end X58 HEDT LGA 1366 based Platform, which launched in 2008.

Part 1: Finding a Board

I decided to try out 1156 as I have never overclocked it before so I set about searching for a cheap board that was decent. 

My first port of call was the overclocking database hwbot.org. For more infomation on hwbot check out my post here: [What is Hwbot]

After browsing submissions I narrowed it down to 4 main choices:

1. [Gigabyte P55A-UD Series]
2. [Asus Maximus 3 Formula]
3. [EVGA Classifed 200]
4. [MSI P55-GD80]


From these choices I decided to narrow it down further to either Gigabyte or Asus as these are the most common in australia. 

After some searching, I discoved a good deal from one of my local haunts for good hardware. I found a Gigabyte motherboard with a unknown i7 and dual quadro for $60. Why so cheap? It had issues of random error codes and not working and the seller couldnt figure it out.

After neogoating with the seller and asking the seller to explain the issues, I had it on its way, minus the GPUs as I didnt need them and was running out of space.

Part 2: So its a go, Right?

So I plugged it all in and got it setup and pressed the power button...

No Boot, nada, nothing. Just code 88 on the post readout...and a RED lED light on the main Bios LED.

![main Bios LED](/assets/img/2023-06-07/P55A UD6 Red LED.jpg){:.centered}<br>

Red LED on the main BIOS, could that be what is causing the issues? 
{:.figcaption}

After some searching I discovered post 88 is comonly present when something is not plugged correctly. So I reseated everything and still no go. :( 

After a few days, I then decided to try a diffrent power supply so I plugged in my Antec 750 which was contected a old system and volia! it boots! ![booted](/assets/img/2023-06-07/P55A-UD6 PSU rig up..JPG)

System starts up!

So What was the mystery i7 chip? it was a i7 860 2.8ghz quad core based lynnfield 

![BootBios](/assets/img/2023-06-07/P55A UD6 successboot first boot.JPG) {:.centered} 

The Chip is revealed as a i7 860.
{:.figcaption}

The board turned out to be a [Gigabyte P55A-UD6]. I was very happy as this board is known for its [high overclocks] and the UD series is known for its [great ram clocking capabilites].

So with such great pedigree, Why not set this up with a great kit of memory? For this task I chose Corsair's PSC (powerchip) based Dominator GTX1 2400mhz CL9-11-9 memory modules, and use 2 sticks to attain a suitable dual channel configuration.

But not so fast...more trouble.

After putting it aside to focus on attaining the [1366 hwbot achievements], I pulled it out and again and tried with the same power supply and it didnt work, same 88 code as before even with the antec PSU that I orignally got it to boot with.
My suspect was the outdated bios.

Part 3: It works..properly!

I waited a few days and switched out the memory to a mixed pair of  2GB Corsair XMS3 1600mhz CL9-9-9 from a triple channel 6GB kit as I had used originally on the intial boot. Susprisinly, the system booted into windows!

The board turns out to be a P55A-UD6 (C) which is the same as the P55A-UD6, just a [naming issue in CPU-Z]

So now that it is booted into windows (10, will setup 7 proper later) and I thought I figured out what it is, why not run some benchmarks before I start to push it?

First lets open up CPU-Z to check.

![low speed](/assets/img/2023-06-07/860 low speed.png)

Something doesnt seem right? Thermal throttling?
{:.figcaption}

After doing a run in with 7 zip to check everything works at stock with no XMP enabled or any overclocking, I gave it a run in Super Pi 32M, a benchmark to calculate 32 million digits of pi.

![Slow 32M](/assets/img/2023-06-07/32M 860 throttled.jpg)

20 mintue 32M run? Thats not right!
{:.figcaption}

The next day I did some reading and after finding a [thread] on Xtreme systems confirming the UD6 and UD6 (C) are the same I updated the bios to the latest F11 revision and switched out the memory to the closest kit I had in my shoebox, my 2000mhz CL7 Gskill Flare PSC kit, binned by a famous overclocker. and reran 32M.

![Full speed](/assets/img/2023-06-07/32M 860 full speed.jpg)

Stock with XMP on the 2000 CL7 Gskill Flares, much better!
{:.figcaption}

Now to retry memory and up the CPU speed. Can I beat [hicookie]?
