Intels P55 Platform is the top of the line for the LGA 1156 Socket of Processors made by Intel. This was first luanched back in 2009 following the High end HEDT LGA 1366 Platform.

Part 1: Finding a Board

I decided to try out 1156 as I have never overclocked it before so I set about searching for a cheap boar that was decent. After some searching, I discoved a good deal on one my local huants for good hardware. I found a Gigabyte motherboard with a unknown i7 and dual quadro for $60.

After neogoating with the seller and explaing the issues I had it on its way minus the GPUs as I didnt need them and was running out of space.

Part 2: So its a go, Right?

So I plugged it all in and got it setup and pressed the power button...

No Boot, nada, nothing. Just code 88 on the post readout...
