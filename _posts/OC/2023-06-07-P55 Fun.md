Intels P55 Platform is the top of the line for the LGA 1156 Socket of Processors made by Intel. This was first launched back in 2009 following the High end X58 HEDT LGA 1366 based Platform.

Part 1: Finding a Board

I decided to try out 1156 as I have never overclocked it before so I set about searching for a cheap board that was decent. 

My first port of call was the overclocking database hwbot.org. For more infomation on hwbot check out my post here: [What is Hwbot]

After browsing submissions I narrowed it down to 4 main choices:

1. [Gigabyte P55A-UD Series]
2. [Asus Maximus 3 Formula]
3. [EVGA Classifed 200]
4. [MSI P55-GD80]


From these choices I decided to narrow it down further to either Gigabyte or Asus as these are the most common in australia. 

After some searching, I discoved a good deal from one of my local haunts for good hardware. I found a Gigabyte motherboard with a unknown i7 and dual quadro for $60. Why so cheap? It had issues of random error codes and not working and he couldnt figure it out.

After neogoating with the seller and asking the seller to explain the issues, I had it on its way, minus the GPUs as I didnt need them and was running out of space.

Part 2: So its a go, Right?

The board arrived, ready for setup

So I plugged it all in and got it setup and pressed the power button...

No Boot, nada, nothing. Just code 88 on the post readout...and a RED lED light on [main Bios LED]

Red LED on the main BIOS, could that be what is causing the issues? {:.figcaption}

After some searching I discovered post 88 is comonly present when something is not plugged correctly. So I reseated everything and still no go. :( 

I then decided to try a diffrent power supply so I plugged in my Antec 750 which was contected a old system and volia! it ![booted](/assets/img/2023-06-07/P55A-UD6 PSU rig up..JPG)

System starts up!

So What was the mystery i7 chip? it was a i7 860 2.8ghz quad core based lynnfield i7 860 2.8ghz quad core based lynnfield ![BootBios](assets/img/2023-06-07/P55A UD6 successboot first boot.JPG) {:.centered} 

The Chip is revealed as a i7 860, the third fastest i7 avaliable.
{:.figcaption}. 

The board turned out to be a [Gigabyte P55A-UD6]. I was very happy as this board is known for its [high overclocks] and the UD series is known for its [great ram clocking capabilites].

So with such great pedigree, Why not set this up some some good kit of memory? For this I choose Corsair's PSC (powerchip) based GTX1 2400 CL9-11-9 memory modules and use 2 sticks to attain dual channel.

But not so fast...more trouble.
