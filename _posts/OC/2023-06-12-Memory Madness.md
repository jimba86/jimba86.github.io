So I have being using some pretty cool memory kits, but what else do I have in my collection?

First off I will break it down into IC type to make it easier.

To Begin I will start with DDR3 as that I what im using in my OC fun at the moment.

PSC:

Corsair GTX Series:

Corsair GTX is the top of the line series of ultra fast, individually binned per stick memory modules avaliable from corsair. The series has been a favorite of overclockers and have been used in many world records.

Kit # 1 Corsair GTX1 2400mhz CL9-11-9

After seeing this kit be used in days of 1156 I thought it would be cool to find a kit and so after much hunting I got very lucky and found one.

This is a very early revision kit with a 8.1 instead of corsair usual 7.1 number to indicate IC type, in this case PSC (powerchip semi conducter)

Kit #2:

Corsair GTX3 2400mhz 9-11-9

The replacement for corsair GTX1, pretty much the same as GTX1. famously used by overclocker gunslinger to  take out X79 world records in a 4 module quad channel setup on a Asus Rampage IV Black Edition. I unfortually have only 3 modules so I cant repliacate that.

Corsair GTX4 2533mhz CL9-10-10 

Corsair GTX6 2665mhz CL9

Corsair speed frequiecny kit of choice. Single sided modules used for frequencey world records. 

Hyper:

Corsair GTX2 2550mhz CL8-8-8 Hyper

Legendary  MGN-E Hyper sticks used in multiple world records, a favorite of X58 and AMD overclockers. Highest hyper binn avliable outside of the Adata 2200 CL8 kit.
