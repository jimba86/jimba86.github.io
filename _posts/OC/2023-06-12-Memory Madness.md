So I have being using some pretty cool memory kits, but what else do I have in my collection?

First off I will break it down into IC type to make it easier.

To Begin I will start with DDR3 as that I what im using in my OC fun at the moment.

Kit # Corsair GTX1 2400 CL9-11-9 PSC

After seeing this kit be used in days of 1156 I thought it would be cool to find a kit and so after much hunting I got very lucky and found one.

This is a very early revision kit with a 8.1 instead of corsair usual 7.1 number to indicate IC type, in this case PSC (powerchip semi conducter)
