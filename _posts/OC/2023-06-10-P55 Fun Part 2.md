So After finding and getting the UD6 to work properly, I set about testing IMC limits, the lazy way. XMP boot test.

For this I chose one of the fastest kits in my collection: Corsair Dominator GTX4 2533mhz CL9 PSC kit.

Did it boot? Yes.

Was it stable? No.

I then tried my GTX1 2400mhz Cl9 kit. 

Did it boot yes

Was it stable? Profile #2 (2400) no. But profile #1 (2333mhz) was and ran cinebench and super pi and Wprime all stable.

I can now work on figuring out core clocks and upping baseclocks.
